QR code scanner that helps to speed up and simplify the inventory checking process. 
## What is inventory checking or stocktaking?
Stocktaking or inventory checking is the physical verification of the quantities and condition of items held in a store or warehouse. It is a critical part of your inventory control and affects purchasing, production and sales. Verification is used in almost every company where stock-keeping units can't be easily calculated. 
## Development process - from idea to implementation
During my work in company I'vre already developed an optimization of process of sending employee to medical examination. You can learn more about the project (here)[https://github.com/iliapnmrv/med]. As I finished my first problem at work using ```PHP```, ```MySQL```, ```JS``` and ```HTML```, I was given a new task: to develop an android application. It was decided to make a QR code scanner that will help to find and mark stock-keeping unit and then display an information to user. I had complete freedom in the choice of technologal stack so after a bit of research I decided to go with JavaScript's framework ```React Native``` and it's framework and a platform for universal React applications ```Expo```. I knew nothing about ```React Native``` and Android development itself. I just knew JavaScript and React basics and I've been given 2 month to learn a new technology and create a working application.

### My application had to:
- Be able to work offline and don't depend on the internet
